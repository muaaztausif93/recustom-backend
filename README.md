# Recustom Frontend Coding Challenge

In order to complete the coding challenge, you will need to do the following
- Fork this repository on Gitlab
- Create a PDF generation module
- Create an HTTP endpoint on `/pdf/generate` that takes a `Clip` as an input (the `Clip` type can be found under `recustom-services/src/graphql/generated.ts`) and returns a PDF file containing
  - The title of the clip
  - The content of the clip (this is HTML generated by a rich text editor)
  - Images of the clip if the clip has `clip_media` of the `Image` type
- Write a simple E2E test that verifies that the endpoint returns a PDF file (no need to check for the contents of the file, just that it returns a PDF file)
- Push your code and share the repository with `saalihou@gmail.com` and let us know that you completed the challenge

Note: the NestJS project where you will be implementing this endpoint is already initialized under the `recustom-services` folder
